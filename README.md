# my-website
This project integrates what I've learned through week three of the GA Software-Engineering Immersive. It puts together HTML, CSS, and (later)Javascript into a functioning personal website. 

## Technologies
So far, only HTML and CSS used. Going to incorporate javascript.
## Challenges
Prioritizing-- wanted horizontal page flow and spent too much time selecting images, had to refocus on basic project requirements.
Changed fonts and colors many times to avoid working on "deliverables" that I expected to be too difficult for me.

## Successes
Used Bootstrap somewhat successfully for the first time! Centered my name on the title page.

Learned more about my process and how I should improve.
